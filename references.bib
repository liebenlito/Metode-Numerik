	abstract = {The essential introduction to computational science—now fully updated and expandedComputational science is an exciting new field at the intersection of the sciences, computer science, and mathematics because much scientific investigation now involves computing as well as theory and experiment. This textbook provides students with a versatile and accessible introduction to the subject. It assumes only a background in high school algebra, enables instructors to follow tailored pathways through the material, and is the only textbook of its kind designed specifically for an introductory course in the computational science and engineering curriculum. While the text itself is generic, an accompanying website offers tutorials and files in a variety of software packages.This fully updated and expanded edition features two new chapters on agent-based simulations and modeling with matrices, ten new project modules, and an additional module on diffusion. Besides increased treatment of high-performance computing and its applications, the book also includes additional quick review questions with answers, exercises, and individual and team projects.The only introductory textbook of its kind—now fully updated and expandedFeatures two new chapters on agent-based simulations and modeling with matricesIncreased coverage of high-performance computing and its applicationsIncludes additional modules, review questions, exercises, and projectsAn online instructor's manual with exercise answers, selected project solutions, and a test bank and solutions (available only to professors)An online illustration package is available to professors},

	abstract = {Malaria is one of the diseases which is caused by the Parasite Plasmodium, such as Falciparum. This parasite is infected into red blood cells of humans by mosquitoes. The infection can be detected using taking a sample of the red blood cells and testing under the microscope. However, testing can be conducted only by experts, and it needs much time to complete. In this study, we will implement a Randomly Wired Neural Network to detect the parasite falciparum in red blood cells. We have been used 27,558 images of red blood cells as data, which were colored by Giemsa. The result of 5-fold cross-validation using the Randomly Wired Neural Network with four random graphs is better than the method of transfer learning in an average accuracy of 95.08\% and 91.99\%, respectively.},
